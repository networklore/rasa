## Project abandoned

This was written as a proof of concept and I didn't move forward on it. A while back I was asked by people from [Rasa](https://rasa.com/) asked if I could give them the project name over at PYPI since it was confusing their users. Since I wasn't planing on continuing the development together with the early stage of this project I gave them access to the rasa project at PYPI.

This code is only left here as a reference.
